## Web Store 2024

(Link: https://aittit.github.io/WebStore/ )

This is a rudimentary web store that uses Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/) to populate it with products,
and simulate a real online store more closely.

The site can be logged into with the following credentials:

username: **Johnd**

password: **m38rmF$**

I made this project in cooperation with another student on the VAMK course **Introduction to Programming** (2024 fall).
The login functionality was made by my peer, otherwise I wrote the program.
